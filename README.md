- [Intel Lava Framework](https://github.com/lava-nc) - software Framework for Neuromorphic Computing from Intel.
- [Moose](https://moose.ncbs.res.in/) -  Multiscale Object-Oriented Simulation Environment. It is designed to simulate neural systems ranging from subcellular components and biochemical reactions to complex models of single neurons, circuits, and large networks.
- [Nengo](https://www.nengo.ai/) - Python package for building, testing, and deploying spiking neural networks.
- [Nest](https://www.nest-simulator.org/) - NEST is a simulator for spiking neural network models that focuses on the dynamics, size and structure of neural systems rather than on the exact morphology of individual neurons.
- [NetPyNE](http://www.netpyne.org/) - Python package to facilitate the development, simulation, parallelization, analysis, and optimization of biological neuronal networks using the NEURON simulator.
- [Neural Circuit Policies](https://github.com/mlech26l/ncps) - Neural Circuit Policies (NCPs) are designed sparse recurrent neural networks loosely inspired by the nervous system of the organism C. elegans. The goal of this package is to making working with NCPs in PyTorch and keras as easy as possible.
- [Neuron Framework](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) - the NEURON simulation environment is used in laboratories and classrooms around the world for building and using computational models of neurons and networks of neurons.
