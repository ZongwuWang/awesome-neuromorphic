## Frameworks

- [BindsNET](https://github.com/BindsNET/bindsnet) - Python package used for simulating spiking neural networks (SNNs) on CPUs or GPUs using PyTorch Tensor functionality.
- [CARLSim](https://github.com/UCI-CARL/CARLsim6) - CARLsim is an efficient, easy-to-use, GPU-accelerated library for simulating large-scale spiking neural network (SNN) models with a high degree of biological detail.
- [GeNN](https://github.com/genn-team/genn) - GeNN is a GPU-enhanced Neuronal Network simulation environment based on code generation for Nvidia CUDA.
- [LAVA](https://github.com/lava-nc) - software Framework for Neuromorphic Computing from Intel.
- [Moose](https://moose.ncbs.res.in/) -  Multiscale Object-Oriented Simulation Environment. It is designed to simulate neural systems ranging from subcellular components and biochemical reactions to complex models of single neurons, circuits, and large networks.
- [Nengo](https://www.nengo.ai/) - Python package for building, testing, and deploying spiking neural networks.
- [NetPyNE]() - Python package to facilitate the development, simulation, parallelization, analysis, and optimization of biological neuronal networks using the NEURON simulator.
- [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) - the NEURON simulation environment is used in laboratories and classrooms around the world for building and using computational models of neurons and networks of neurons.
- [NEST](https://www.nest-simulator.org/) - NEST is a simulator for spiking neural network models that focuses on the dynamics, size and structure of neural systems rather than on the exact morphology of individual neurons.
- [Norse](https://norse.github.io/norse/index.html) -  aims to exploit the advantages of bio-inspired neural components, which are sparse and event-driven - a fundamental difference from artificial neural networks. Norse expands PyTorch with primitives for bio-inspired neural components.
- [PeleNet](https://github.com/sagacitysite/pelenet) - reservoir computing framework for Loihi.
- [PyNN](https://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/) - Python package for simulator-independent specification of neuronal network models.
- [PySNN](https://github.com/BasBuller/PySNN) - spiking neural network (SNN) framework written on top of PyTorch for efficient simulation of SNNs both on CPU and GPU.
- [Sinabs](https://www.synsense.ai/products/sinabs/) - open source PyTorch based library, developed to design and implement Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNNs).
- [SPAIC](https://github.com/ZhejianglabNCRC/SPAIC) - spike-based artificial intelligence computing platform. [Python]
- [SpikingJelly](https://github.com/fangwei123456/spikingjelly) - open-source deep learning framework for Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based on PyTorch.
